Dear Prof. Tan,

Thank you for your message and for letting me know about your travel next week. I apologize for sending a calendar invite before we had agreed on a time—I appreciate your patience.

To keep things moving on our funded research project (and the paperwork for extending the end date), could we set up a brief 30-minute call? I’m available at either of the windows below:
Option	US Eastern (ET)	Japan Standard Time (JST)
1	Mon 26 May – 8:00 p.m.	Tue 27 May – 9:00 a.m.
2	Tue 27 May – 8:00 p.m.	Wed 28 May – 9:00 a.m.

If neither slot works, please let me know a time that is convenient for you and I’ll gladly adjust. Once we confirm, I’ll send a fresh calendar invitation with the correct details.

Looking forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,

Shatad Purohit
