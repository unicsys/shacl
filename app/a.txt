The Problem: The complex web of requirements that defines our systems exists only as natural language text, making it inaccessible to computers and creating a massive blind spot for risk analysis.

The Solution: We are using a team of AI agents to systematically translate this text into a formal knowledge graphâ€”a network of connected facts that a computer can understand as fluently as an engineer.

The Impact: This eliminates manual data-hunting, provides instant, 100% accurate impact analysis, and gives us a level of programmatic oversight that was previously unimaginable.
