Subject: Clarification on Role and Next Steps for F119 Digital Twin Demo (Ontology/KG)

Dear [Project Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out regarding the F119 Digital Twin Demo – Raptor Clone project. I understand that my specific deliverable, due by August 31, involves developing an ontology or knowledge graph for the selected engine part, with the goal of enabling decision support and scalability across other parts and systems.

To better align my efforts with the team's goals, I’d appreciate any guidance you can share on the following:

    Are there specific decision support questions or use cases the team envisions the KG should address?

    Is there a target schema, data model, or format that the ontology should align with?

    Are there any existing data sources, formats, or documentation I should review to begin modeling?

    Could we set up a brief meeting or call to walk through the expected scope and technical direction?

I’m excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to your guidance on how to proceed.

Best regards,
Shatad Purohit
