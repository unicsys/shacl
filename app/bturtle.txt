Hi Megan,

Thanks for the warm introduction and for outlining the vision around Graph Studio.

Rob and I have already connected and plan to reconvene once he wraps up his current deliverable. In parallel, I’d welcome a joint session with you and Patrick to:

    walk through the enterprise-level capabilities now available in Graph Studio (model onboarding, reasoning, security, DevOps, etc.);

    review Collins’ current use-case threads and key lessons learned; and

    discuss how the platform might plug into our existing ontology-governance and integration roadmap.

REO is still being socialized internally, so I’ll keep the discussion at a high level but can share representative patterns and integration requirements.

My upcoming availability (PT):

    Tue 10 Jun 09:00 – 11:00

    Wed 11 Jun 13:00 – 15:00

    Fri 13 Jun 08:00 – 11:00

Feel free to send a hold that suits everyone.

Looking forward to comparing notes.

Best,
Shatad
