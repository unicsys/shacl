Subject: Project [Insert Project Name/ID if you have one] - Timeline Discussion & Meeting Request
Dear Prof. Tan,
I hope this email finds you well.
My name is Shatad Purohit, and I've recently taken over from Jise Miguele Pasini at RTX Technology Research Center as your point of contact for our ongoing project. I'm looking forward to working with you, alongside Sriram from Collins Aerospace.
Following recent discussions with Sriram regarding the project requirements, he has strongly recommended extending the project timeline. The proposal is to adjust the duration to 12 months, with a new projected end date of June 2026, instead of the current December 2025. Sriram believes this additional time is crucial to ensure we can deliver a truly valuable outcome.
I am currently initiating the internal workflow at RTX to process this potential extension.
Before we proceed further, we would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this proposed change with you and get your input to ensure it aligns with your perspective. This would be a quick 20-30 minute discussion.
To make scheduling easier, would any of the following times work for you?
•	[Day], [Date] at [Time] [Your Time Zone, e.g., EST]
•	[Day], [Date] at [Time] [Your Time Zone]
•	[Day], [Date] at [Time] [Your Time Zone]
Please let me know if any of these suit you, or suggest an alternative time that works best on your end.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
Shatad Purohit
