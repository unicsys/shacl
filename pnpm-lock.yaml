Hi [Name],
On Monday, I met with Megan Mercer from RealmOne, the Anzo consulting partner that Collins is engaging with. She has spoken with several Collins colleagues who are interested in working ahead on knowledge graph development for their use cases. Based on that discussion, I found:
•	RealmOne’s scope is – mapping data into Anzo, building queries, and creating dashboards.
•	Out-of-scope items are – defining the business problem, modeling or extending ontologies, reusing existing RTX ontology assets, and ensuring alignment with the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO).
•	Gap – those out-of-scope tasks still need to be done, and our RTX ontology group can cover them. We can also train Collins team members so they can maintain the models going forward.
Below is a view of the ontology / knowledge-graph life-cycle in simple language and typical ownership.
#	What happens	Who usually drives it	Notes
1	Define the goal – agree on the business question and why a graph helps	Collins SMEs + RTX Ontology Team	Example: “Which factors most influence repair turnaround time?”
2	Frame key questions that the graph must answer	RTX Ontology Team (facilitates)	We call these decision-support / competency questions
3	Reuse existing assets – look for and reuse internal ontologies and modeling patterns	RTX Ontology Team	Avoid reinventing what we already have
4	Design / extend the ontology – classes, relations, simple logic rules, REO alignment	RTX Ontology Team	RealmOne does not build ontologies
5	Map the data into Anzo	RealmOne / Anzo	We review for semantic fit
6	Build the graph & run queries	RealmOne / Anzo	Iterative testing with Collins SMEs
7	Create dashboards / reports	RealmOne / Anzo	Visualize answers from Step 2
8	Validate & iterate	Collins SMEs + RTX + RealmOne	Tight feedback loop
9	Govern & maintain – versioning, future changes	Collins + RTX Ontology Team	Keeps everything REO-compliant


Next step: Could we set up a short call to walk through Steps,  and discuss needs? I’m available this week and early next—just let me know what works for you.
Thanks, and looking forward to collaborating.
Best,
Shatad
