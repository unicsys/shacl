PW–USAF Inspection-Automation KG Pilot — Overview & Use Case Quick-Start Proposal
Hello,
Attached is an 8-minute voice-over presentation that walks through our recent PW - USAF inspection-automation knowledge graph pilot that we did at MBDT PCC.
In approximately 150 hours, we were able to:
•	Re-used proven modeling patterns to stand up the ontology
•	Built a knowledge graph on a free, on-prem graph platform
•	Execute queries to answer key decision-support questions (DSQs).
•	Build a unified dashboard for clear insights.
•	Deliver 5 training sessions on knowledge graph development.
A key to this rapid progress is that the modeling patterns hide most formal-ontology complexity, enabling domain experts to contribute effectively without needing deep semantic-web expertise.
To illustrate how we approach these projects and ensure a clear division of work, here’s our typical Collaborative Lifecycle and ownership for Ontology & Knowledge Graph Development:

#	Phase	Key activities	Primary owner	Support / tools
1	Scope & DSQs	Define purpose, decision-support questions (DSQs), success metrics	BU stakeholders	MBDT ontology lead; workshop template
2	ROI case	Quantify cost, time, and compliance benefits	BU stakeholders	MBDT ontology lead
3	Pattern reuse & extension	Import patterns; extend classes/relations; align to REO	MBDT ontology lead; BU Stakeholders	MBDT Modeling-pattern library
4	Data mapping	Map source tables/files to ontology terms	MBDT ontology lead; BU Stakeholders	MBDT Mapping-tool templates
5	Graph build	Ingest & materialize triples	MBDT ontology lead; BU data owners	Free graph platform or Enterprise graph platform
6	Query & analytics	Run SPARQL queries to extract insights, answer DSQs.	MBDT ontology lead	MBDT Sample query pack
7	Dashboards	Assemble charts & unified views	MBDT ontology lead; BU Stakeholders	Graph UI, Python GUI libraries
8	Validation	Spot-check results; iterate	BU Stakeholders	DSQ review 
9	Govern & evolve	Ownership, versioning, change control	MBDT ontology team; BU Stakeholders	Ontology Hub

Early Assistance
For the initial Phases 1 (Scope & DSQs) and Phase 2 (ROI Case), I can contribute a total of 6 hours over the next 3 weeks. This support will be under our existing MBDT proposal-prep charge code, so no Inter-Divisional Work Authorization (IDWA) is required for this foundational work.
Next Steps
1.	Share potential use cases that need automated insights, unified data views, or improved decision support.
2.	Send any high-value Decision Support Questions you have in mind and we’ll refine it together.
3.	Let’s set up a 30-min walkthrough of pattern reuse or mapping workflows.
This staged approach allows us to stand up new use cases faster while maintaining rigor and delivering clear value.
Thanks,
