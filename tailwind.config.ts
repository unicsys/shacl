Hi Jim,

Thanks for staying in touch about IOF. I attended the recent OAGi ontology conference and found the sessions on BFO foundations, modeling patterns, and real‐world use cases particularly valuable. They clarified how IOF’s approach could fit our own knowledge‐graph work.

The roster of active working groups and leads you shared is exactly what I need as I build the internal case for RTX to join IOF. I’m now gathering feedback from leadership and partner teams.

If you have a concise overview—member benefits, recent success stories, and typical time commitments for working‐group participation—it would help strengthen the proposal. Please send anything you have handy.

I’ll keep you posted on our progress and reach out as soon as I have an update.

Appreciate your patience and support.

Best regards,
