I'd like to propose an evaluation criterion focused on vendor lock-in risk and the proprietary nature of the technology stack. This includes assessing:

    How tightly coupled the tool is to proprietary standards or formats

    The availability of open input/output formats (e.g., RDF, OWL, TTL, JSON-LD, CSV)

    Exportability and interoperability with other systems

    Long-term maintainability if we choose to migrate away from the tool

This criterion ensures we retain flexibility and control over our data and models in the long run.
