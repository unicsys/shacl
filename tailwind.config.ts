Step 1: Achieve Total Visibility (What is my fleet's true configuration?)

These questions establish the factual baseline. They create the single source of truth by linking our siloed data.

    What parts were on the engine at a given time?

    When did parts get removed or swapped?

    What inspection data (from ESAS) was available at a given time?

    When and how frequently does coating loss get captured in the ESAS system?

Step 2: Discover the "Why" (Why are parts failing and degrading?)

These questions help us perform root cause analysis. We move from knowing what happened to understanding why it happened by finding correlations in the data.

    Why did parts get removed? (from maintenance records)

    What parts were on the engine during a step change in coating loss?

    Do specific parts exhibit higher/lower coating loss compared to other parts?

    What flight conditions or events (or mission types) correlate with changes in coating loss?

    Are there any other health data that correlate with coating loss? (e.g., high vibrations, temperatures)

    What types of transient operations are correlated with changes in coating loss?

    What base locations or weather conditions correlate with changes in coating loss?

Step 3: Predict the Future (What will fail next?)

Using the patterns discovered in Step 2, these questions allow us to build predictive models and forecast future events, moving us from a reactive to a proactive stance.

    When will an engine, assembly, or part be predicted to exceed the limit of acceptable coating loss?

Step 4: Prescribe the Smartest Action (What is the best decision right now?)

This is the ultimate goal. The system uses the predictions from Step 3 to recommend optimal actions that balance cost, risk, and readiness.

    When should I replace a part to recover coating loss?

    Which part(s) should I replace?

    Which flight conditions could we potentially modify to minimize expected coating loss?
