Hi [Recipient's Name],
Thank you for the reply. First off, congratulations to you and the Collins DPLC team on your incredible success. Generating over $100M in value from your knowledge graphs is a phenomenal achievement and a benchmark for the rest of RTX. This is exactly the kind of impactful work we want to learn from and amplify.
To clarify the goal for our discussion: it is not to disrupt or replace the great work you are doing. The timing for this is prompted by a recent conversation with the Anzo team. They reached out to us because they are helping other Collins SBUs build their own KGs and were asking about enterprise ontology and reusable patterns to accelerate that work.
Their request highlighted two critical questions for us at the enterprise level:
1.	How do we ensure the powerful knowledge graphs being built, like yours, can eventually connect and 'talk to each other' to answer cross-business unit questions?
2.	How can we enable other teams to reuse proven models from successful projects like yours to accelerate development and avoid reinventing the wheel?
The answer to both questions lies in a common foundation. That's why our RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO) is built upon established W3C standards (RDF/OWL) and aligns with a top-level framework called Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is an ISO standard. This standards-based approach is becoming best practice in the industry (see attached image).
By aligning your existing KGs with the REO—which can often be done through lightweight mapping without changing your core structure—we can begin to build those bridges.
I'm glad you're open to a 30-minute discussion. We can use the time to:
•	Briefly hear about your successful implementations so we can learn.
•	Discuss the REO and how we can create a simple bridge to your KGs.
I will send a calendar invitation. Looking forward to connecting and learning.
Best regards,
