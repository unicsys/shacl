Hello Team,

I am working on a project that involves leveraging our enterprise knowledge graph on the [Platform Name] platform.

To support this project, I have developed a domain ontology using the Protégé ontology editor. I also have a set of SPARQL queries, built within Protégé, that I intend to use for data retrieval and analysis.

Could you please provide guidance on the following two items?

    Importing an OWL Ontology: What is the process for importing an ontology file (in .owl format) onto the platform?

    Executing SPARQL Queries: How can I execute my existing SPARQL queries against the knowledge graph? Is there a specific interface or SPARQL endpoint I should be using?

Any available documentation, step-by-step guides, or best practices you could share would be very helpful.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
