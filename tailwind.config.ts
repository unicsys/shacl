I hope you are having a great week.

I am preparing my Form I-983 for my STEM OPT extension and would appreciate your guidance to ensure it's completed correctly.

I've attached the form, along with a sample guide from my university (USC) that has some specific instructions. To help make the process as smooth as possible, I wanted to point out a couple of key areas the guide mentions:

    Page 2 seems to require the official employer details (like the EIN) and a signature in the "Employer Certification" section.

    Page 4 has a separate "Certifying Official" signature for the training plan, which I have drafted for your review.

    Page 5 is for future evaluations and should be left blank for this initial submission.

Could you please take a look when you have a moment and let me know the best way to proceed? I'm ready to provide any additional information you might need.

Thank you so much for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
