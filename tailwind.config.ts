Subject: Inspection Digital Twin Project – Deliverables Archived & Ideas for Next Steps

Hi Keith,

I wanted to close the loop on the Pratt & Whitney / USAF inspection-digital-twin effort you sponsored:

    Project wrap-up: All deliverables—the ontology files, knowledge-graph instance, SPARQL queries, dashboard mock-ups, and workshop slide decks—are archived in our secure SharePoint folder here → <link>.

    Status: The final review was accepted on <date>, and no open actions remain.

I’m excited about the momentum we built and would love your thoughts on a follow-on phase. A few possibilities we’ve heard from stakeholders:

    Automated ingestion & labeling of new inspection data streams (e.g., borescope images) into the existing KG.

    Decision-support extensions that link inspection findings directly to maintenance-action recommendations.

    Scaled deployment pilots at a second engine depot to validate cross-site interoperability.

Do any of these align with your priorities, or is there another direction you’d like us to explore? I’m happy to draft a short concept note or set up a 30-minute call next week.

Thanks again for your support on the first phase, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,

Shatad
