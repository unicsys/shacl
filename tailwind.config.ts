This project builds a living digital model of our engine fleet, allowing us to answer progressively more valuable questions. We are moving from basic reporting to predictive and prescriptive analytics, turning our data into a strategic asset for readiness.
Step 1: Total Visibility

The goal is to establish a single source of truth for 100% configuration control and auditability.

We answer:

    What is the exact configuration of any engine, at any time?

    What is the complete service history of a specific part?

    Show all historical inspection data for any asset.

Step 2: Discover the “Why”

The goal is to perform rapid root cause analysis to understand the drivers of degradation and failure.

We answer:

    Why was a specific part actually removed from service?

    How do mission types or flight conditions impact part life?

    Does higher engine vibration correlate to faster coating loss?

    Do parts degrade faster at coastal vs. desert bases?

Step 3: Predict the Future

The goal is to forecast failures and risks before they can impact operations, enabling proactive maintenance.

We answer:

    What is the remaining useful life of this specific component?

    Which 10 engines across the fleet are at the highest risk of failure this month?

Step 4: Prescribe the Smartest Action

The goal is to use our predictions to recommend optimal decisions that balance cost, risk, and readiness.

We answer:

    What is the optimal time to replace a part?

    Which operational changes would best extend the life of our fleet?

    What is the most cost-effective strategy to maintain mission readiness?
