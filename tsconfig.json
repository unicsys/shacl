Subject: Question about leave on [Date]

Hi [Manager's Name],

I need to request leave on [Date] to handle a personal commitment.

I know we have our 1:1 that afternoon. I was wondering if you'd prefer to postpone it to later in the week or perhaps prepone it to the day before? Please let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
