I'm writing to express my interest in contributing to the AI task force's CRAD initiatives and to find where my skills can add the most value.

My current work is in building verifiable knowledge systems: formal ontology, knowledge-graph construction, and logic-based validation using SHACL and OWL for various BU projects. Since last 2 years (during my PhD and now at RTX) I'm actively exploring how to integrate transformer models and Graph Neural Networks with these formal knowledge structures to create more powerful, hybrid solutions. One example is I recently applied for Raytheon/USAF pilot. For that, I’m also finalizing a short white paper on auto converting unstructured aerospace standards into ontology-backed knowledge graphs. 

I understand one of the key initiatives is tackling LLM hallucination, and I see a direct application there—using knowledge graphs as a factual grounding layer. However, this is broadly applicable to other challenges too. Any initiative requiring robust data integration, enhanced semantic structures, or data validation could benefit from this approach.

For additional context, my approach is influenced by my background. I hold a PhD in Astronautical Engineering specializing in systems architecting and engineering, where I worked on Model-based Systems Engineering, Multidisciplinary design optimization, and Markov models. Prior to that, I was at Dassault Systèmes, working directly on their systems engineering tools with Modelica and SysML

I’m happy to pivot beyond my current work and apply skills wherever the AI Task Force needs them.
Could you point me to any project or proposal team that would benefit from this.

Best regards,
