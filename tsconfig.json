Hi [Anzo Contact Name(s)],

I hope you are well.

First, thank you again for connecting me with Kayla and her team at Collins. That introduction was very helpful.

I have a positive update for you regarding our conversation about the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO) and our reusable modeling patterns. After speaking with my management and several teams within our research center, I'm pleased to confirm that we are cleared to share these resources with your team at Anzo.

My main objective was to clear this hurdle for you. We believe that giving your team direct access to the REO and our patterns will significantly accelerate your work in helping Collins SBUs build their new knowledge graphs, ensuring they are designed for enterprise-wide interoperability from the start.

To enable this, we just need to confirm that an appropriate Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is in place. Could you please let me know if Anzo has an existing NDA signed with RTX corporate, the Collins business unit, or perhaps specifically with Rob's organization?

Once we confirm the NDA status, we can coordinate the next steps for sharing the materials.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
