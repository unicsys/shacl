Hi [Anzo Contact Name(s)],

I have a great update following our last conversation.

I spoke with my management about the requirements for sharing the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO) and our modeling patterns, and we confirmed that an NDA would be needed to proceed.

To clear that hurdle, I reached out to Rob at Collins, and he confirmed that an active NDA is already in place between Altair and his organization. This is excellent news, as it means we are all set to move forward without any delays.

Our primary goal is to help you accelerate the adoption of the REO with the Collins teams you're working with, ensuring the knowledge graphs you help build are faster to develop and interoperable. This is also a fantastic opportunity for us to learn from you; your team's real-world feedback will be invaluable for helping us improve the ontology for everyone.

With all the logistics now cleared, I'd like to schedule a 30-minute call next week to kick things off. We can use the time to walk you through the REO structure and plan the best way to share these resources with your team.

Please let me know what day and time works best for you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
