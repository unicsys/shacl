To eliminate the high-risk, manual gap between technical design (TDP) and factory execution (MDP). We will develop an intelligent agent-based system where a federation of autonomous software agents ingests diverse technical data, constructs and reasons over a manufacturing knowledge graph, and automates production planning. Our risk-mitigated plan proves this capability on a core component in Year 1, generating foundational mBOMs and process plans. We will then scale to full assemblies in Years 2-3, closing the digital thread. This approach radically reduces planning lead times and errors, securing a decisive industrial advantage in responsiveness and affordability.
