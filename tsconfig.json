Subject: Follow-Up: I-983 Update and EAD Filing Clarification

Hi [HR's Name],

Thank you again for your support and for letting me know about the timeline. July 7 works well, and I appreciate you checking on the employer name with your legal team. If that’s the name used for E-Verify, we can keep it as is — no problem.

I did want to kindly request that we update the site address on Page 3 of the I-983 to reflect my home address, since I am working fully remotely. The company address on Page 2 can remain unchanged.

Also, I wanted to confirm one key point related to the next steps in my STEM OPT application:

I plan to file Form I-765 for the STEM OPT extension as soon as I receive the signed I-983, submit my I-20 request to USC, and obtain the updated I-20. Once filed, I will receive an automatic 180-day extension of my work authorization, which allows me to continue working legally while the renewal is pending.
→ Could you please confirm that RTX is okay with relying on this automatic 180-day extension, and that a physical EAD card is not required before August 20 for me to stay on payroll?

Let me know if you need any documentation from my side — I’d be happy to provide the USCIS or USC OIS references regarding this policy.

Thanks again for all your help!

Best regards,
Shatad
