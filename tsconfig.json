Dear Casey,

I hope you are having a good week.

I am preparing my application for the STEM OPT extension and have attached my Form I-983 for your review and signature. I have also attached the sample guide provided by my university (USC) which has specific instructions.

Based on the requirements, I need your help with the following:

    Page 2 (Employer Information): Please complete the employer details (EIN, etc.) and sign the "Employer Certification" at the bottom of this page.

    Pages 3 & 4 (Training Plan): I have drafted the training plan. Please review it and provide the second signature on Page 4 under the "Certifying Official" section for the training plan.

    Page 5 (Evaluations): This page should be left blank for now, as it is for evaluations during my extension period.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if any changes are needed in the training plan draft. Thank you for your time and assistance with this.

Best regards,

Shatad Kolin Purohit
