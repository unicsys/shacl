Subject: Minor Updates to I-983 Form – Site Address and Employer Name

Hi [HR's Name],

Thank you again for sending over the signed I-983 form.

I had a call earlier today with the USC Office of International Services (OIS) advisor to review the form and confirm details. Based on that discussion and the sample I-983 they provided, there are a couple of minor updates needed:

    Page 3 – Site Address: Since I am working 100% remotely, this should reflect my home address as the training site location.

    Employer Name (Pages 2 and 3): This should match the E-Verify registered name exactly. If it already matches, then no changes are needed.

The Page 2 employer address can remain as the company’s official address.

Could you please help update these fields accordingly, or let me know if you’d prefer I make the edits and send it back for signature?

Appreciate your help as always!

Best regards,
Shatad
