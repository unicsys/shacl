Goal 1 -
•	For internal and external MBE T&GE site, structured and drafted initial pages. Integrated key features, established connections to critical sub-pages, and implemented a modern, user-friendly layout to centralize our resources.
•	Architected and led the first successful overhaul of our internal ontology knowledge base, launching the new Ontology Hub (oHub) where previous attempts had stalled. This is delivering a critical, long-awaited asset to the organization.
•	Centralized knowledge-sharing by designing a modern, user-friendly platform with curated materials, increasing the accessibility and usability of ontology resources for all stakeholders.
•	Ensuring on-time delivery by directing the full project lifecycle, from defining clear requirements and creating detailed mock-ups to managing and following up with the development team's execution.

Goal 2 – 
•	For CRAD pipeline, identifying and qualifying 3 new CRAD/AI opportunities from the ARL BAA, delivering a formal white paper to the Business Development team to accelerate pursuit. The proposal is in review.
•	De-risked technology by developing a functional Proof of Concept (POC) that successfully converted complex DiD documents into a knowledge graph using AI.
•	Proved real-world value by applying the POC to an active Raytheon/USAF project, delivering a shareable solution that strengthened the customer partnership and demonstrated tangible ROI.

Goal 3 – 
•	Enhanced our competitive edge by gathering and integrating new industry-standard ontologies (supply chain, maintenance) and modeling patterns from the OAGi conference into our central oHub.
•	At OAGi, identified new solution opportunities through direct engagement with current and prospective customers to diagnose pain points, strengthening relationships and informing our strategy.
•	Based on insights from OAGi conference, created a radar chart on semantic tech and standard adoption across industry. 
•	Accelerated partner adoption of our standards by delivering a targeted technical demo of REO and modeling patterns to Altair, enabling them to better support multiple teams across RTX.

Goal 4 – 
•	Completed advanced certifications to build expertise in high-priority digital engineering domains. (from platforms like deeplearning.ai, coursera, edx, datacamp, MIT OCW)
•	Acquired project-ready skills in Agentic AI, Graph Neural Networks, and MLOps, directly supporting the company’s strategic push into next-generation AI and ensuring immediate applicability.
•	Strengthened my technical core by mastering key data and graph technologies (SPARQL, Databricks), increasing my ability to architect and deliver more robust and scalable ontology solutions.

Goal 5 – 
•	Directly increased BU capability by developing and delivering 5 targeted training workshops that upskilled 28 engineers at PW in practical knowledge graph principles.
•	Drove strategic alignment by campaigning the value of ontology to key cross-functional teams (AI, Data Governance, KG Dev), securing critical buy-in for new and ongoing initiatives.

Goal 6 – 
•	Rescued a project by leading negotiations with Legal and Finance to resolve contractual stalls, securing a 12-month project and protecting our initial investment.
•	Reengaged with the Collins customer and re-scoped the collaboration to align university research directly with priority RTX applications

Goal 7 – 
•	Expanded the footprint of ontology by launching multiple new knowledge graph projects, including the first-ever engagement with the EDX team and the successful completion of the PW/USAF pilot. Initiated the Raptor Clone Project, defining the scope and drafting the initial ontology.
•	Positioned a major new IRAD proposal around our knowledge graph and AI technology, making us the core of a three-team effort.
•	Advanced IRAD projects (CCA, TDP to MDP) by shaping their technical direction and driving progress toward key milestones.
•	Facilitated a new collaboration between Collins and Altair to develop an REO-based knowledge graph, expanding the adoption of our core standards.
•	Secured top-down organizational support by gaining the Data Governance director’s endorsement to promote ontology standards, a critical step for driving enterprise-wide adoption.
