Hi [Anzo Contact Name(s)],
First, thank you for sharing contacts of Kayla and Piper. That introduction was very helpful.
After our las call I scheduled calls with my management and team at RTRC to see how can we handle the hurdle of sharing REO and modeling patterns with you so that we can help accelerate adoption of REO with collins teams that you are working with. And we build knowledge graph faster and more interoperable.
 I have a positive update for you regarding our conversation about the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO) and our reusable modeling patterns. After speaking with my management and teams within our research center, I want to confirm that we are cleared to share these resources with your team at Altair.
To enable this, we just need to confirm that an appropriate NDA is in place. Could you please let me know if Altair has an existing NDA signed with RTX corporate, the Collins business unit, or perhaps specifically with Rob's organization?
Once we confirm the NDA status, we can coordinate the next steps.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
