Hi Alberto,

I just met with Megan Merce from RealmOne, the Anzo consulting partner engaged by Collins. She’s talking with the Landing Systems, Aftermarket, and Power & Controls teams, but her remit is limited to data mapping into Anzo and building dashboards/queries.

Defining use-case scope, designing ontologies, and aligning models to the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO) are out of her scope, and she’s looking to us to fill that gap.

How would you like us to support RealmOne without exposing REO or our internal modeling patterns?
Question: How do we support them without exposing REO or our internal modeling patterns and internal ontologies?

Gap: RealmOne cannot define use-case scope, design ontologies, or align models to the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO). They’re asking us to fill that gap.

Thanks,
Shatad
