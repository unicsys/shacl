Subject: Request – SWISS Ontology & API Assets for Possible KG Link-up
Hi [Colleague’s name],
I spent some time reviewing Exiger/XSB material on SWISS and wanted to share two quick findings and a request. I believe there's an opportunity to connect the SWISS knowledge graphs with our BFO based knowledge graphs.

I’m confident SWISS has a formal ontology
•	XSB states that all of its applications run on an “efficient, scalable Ontology Management System” and that SWISS reasoning is implemented in rule-based logic for full explainability. https://xsb.com/ai-semantics/
•	This article mentions that SWISS builds a linked-data model, where every concept knows its meaning, status, and relationship to other data.
That language only makes sense if SWISS is backed by a rigorously defined OWL/RDF schema rather than an ad-hoc property set.

What we would need next
1.	Preferred – the OWL/RDF (or at least a class / property reference) for the SWISS ontology so we can map their ontology to to our BFO/CCO based ontology and make the knowledge graph interoperable.
2.	If the ontology can’t be shared, the next-best artefacts:
o	OpenAPI / Swagger JSON or GraphQL SDL file for the SWISS API
o	Example payloads that include JSON-LD @context headers
o	Read-only sandbox credentials 
These let us auto-discover the SWISS schema in a way 
Once we have either the ontology or the exposed API schema we can:
•	Draft an interface ontology 
•	Use SPARQL CONSTRUCT or a light ETL job to rename predicates and attach provenance 
•	Validate with SHACL and iterate.

Let me know Whether you already have access to the SWISS ontology or API developer kit, 
Best,
Shatad Purohit
