i [Anzo Contact Name(s)],

First, thank you for sharing the contacts for Kayla and Piper. That introduction was very helpful.

I have a positive update following our last call. I looked into how we could handle the hurdle of sharing our intellectual property, and I'm pleased to confirm that my management has cleared us to share the RTX Enterprise Ontology (REO) and our reusable modeling patterns with your team.

Our goal here is to help you accelerate the adoption of the REO with the Collins teams you're working with, ensuring the knowledge graphs you help build are faster to develop and interoperable across the enterprise.

To enable this, we just need to confirm that an appropriate NDA is in place. Could you please let me know if Anzo/Altair has an existing NDA signed with RTX corporate, the Collins business unit, or perhaps specifically with Rob's organization?

Once we confirm the NDA status, we can coordinate the next steps for sharing the materials.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
