Hi [Sender's Name],

Thank you for the feedback on the presentation. I'm happy to hear that you see the value in our work and are moving forward with including these capabilities in the DAC roadmap.

I would be happy to support the Meeting with STC. I look forward to learning more about their capabilities as well.

To ensure we have a focused discussion with an external partner like STC, I would propose that for this initial meeting, we concentrate on the portion of our solution architecture directly applicable to the DiD-to-Ontology conversion. My presentation can showcase the results and capabilities of our process, demonstrating the value we bring, while keeping the high-level mechanics of how we achieve it.

We can hold the more detailed aspects of our complete architecture (like connecting with semi-structured, structured data, coordination agents, etc) for internal RTX discussions.

For DiD-to-Ontology architecture portion, I am happy to share and discuss the foundational, open-source research work and public methodologies that our solution is built upon.

Regarding availability for a one-hour meeting, here are some times that work for me:

      
Wednesday: 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM ET

Thursday: 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM ET
