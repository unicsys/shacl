Reconnecting: A Strategic Link Between Enterprise Ontology and Data Governance Success

We briefly connected a few weeks back about the RTX Enterprise Ontology. I wanted to reconnect on the enabling link between data governance and high level enterprise ontology, as I believe the timing is now critical.  I’ve spent some time reviewing the documentation on the Data Governance initiative that you shared.
The mission to make high-quality data discoverable and empower teams with standardized practices is perfectly aligned with what we are trying to support with our efforts.

You asked about the enabling link between Data Governance and Ontology. Having reviewed your framework, I see a powerful and direct connection.

The most immediate impact is on your ‘Data Catalog’ part of scope. Your documentation correctly identifies the Data Catalog as a core tooling capability. This is the place where ontology provides value. Here's how:
• A standard data catalog can tell you what data assets exist (tables, files, reports). By integrating the Enterprise Ontology, the catalog can also understand what those assets mean in a business context. It transforms the catalog from a simple inventory into a true knowledge graph, allowing users to discover data based on business concepts, not just technical names.
• The ontology maps these business terms to all the relevant underlying data assets, regardless of their physical location or naming. This directly supports your mission to make data discoverable and addresses the key question, ‘Can we find the data we need, when we need it?’

Beyond the catalog, there is a more strategic reason for our teams to align now. We are seeing several knowledge graph initiatives spring up across different business units. While this innovation is exciting, it presents a significant risk to your enterprise-wide goals.
Without a common foundation, we risk creating new, sophisticated ‘graph silos’. Each knowledge graph will have its own definition of Customer, Product, or Contract, etc. recreating the very problem of diverging processes and lack of a single source of truth. This will ultimately increase costs and inhibit cross-enterprise analytics.
I am convinced that a strong alignment between our teams is a massive accelerator for your roadmap. I would be happy to schedule a brief 20-30 minute session to walk you through how the ontology connects to your framework.
