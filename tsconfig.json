Hi [HR's Name],

Thank you for the update — I completely understand and appreciate your help, especially with your upcoming travel. July 7 works for me.

Regarding the employer name on the I-983: if the current version is what your team uses for E-Verify or legal filings, I’m happy to keep it as is. I understand you'll check with your attorney — no problem there. I’d just like to kindly request that we update the site address on Page 3 to reflect my home address, since I’m working fully remotely.

Also, one quick clarification I was hoping you could help with:
My current EAD expires on August 20, and I’m preparing to file the I-765 for the STEM OPT extension. Do you know if USCIS requires the new EAD card to be issued before August 20, or is it sufficient that the I-765 application is filed by then?

Thanks again for all your support!

Best regards,
Shatad
