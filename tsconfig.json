Of course. This DEVCOM ARL BAA (W911NF-23-S-0001) is an excellent source of opportunities. Your research areas in ontology, knowledge graphs, GNNs, semantic technologies, and AI verification/explainability are in high demand, as they are the foundational technologies needed to solve many of the Army's most difficult problems in information science and AI.

Based on the document you provided, here is a curated list of the most relevant research topics for a potential CRAD. I have categorized them into "Primary Targets" (direct bullseye matches) and "Strong Secondary Targets" (excellent application areas for your work).
Primary Targets (Directly Aligned with Your Research)

These topics explicitly call for the kind of research you do. Your whitepaper should directly reference the language used in these descriptions.

1. Knowledge Systems (ARL-BAA-0033)

    TPOC: Robert St Amant, PhD - robert.a.stamant2.civ@army.mil

    Connection: This is a perfect match. It directly calls for "advances in knowledge representation," "reasoning about graphs," and "Engineering AI Systems" with a focus on "AI safety - rigorous specifications for composition, run-time monitoring... reasoning." This aligns with your entire research portfolio.
